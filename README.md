# Requirements
Create a (virtual) python environment and install the libraries/dependencies, preferably using conda:

```bash
  conda install --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge -y
```

Step 1: Download and process the population data using the Python script. Then export it.

Step 2: Open the population raster layer in QGIS and apply the ready-made style. You may need to adjust the values in the style/symbology if you are using it for a different study area.
